# QEMU and using Golang

Apparently QEMU booting directly and skipping GRUB
qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt -kernel arch/riscv/boot/Image
Switching to the UART view, we see that OpenSBI tidily started and the Linux took over! Great! We even see some references to the SBI layer that we have discussed before:

# FIL-C
Fil-C is a fanatically compatible memory-safe implementation of C and C++. Lots of software compiles and runs with Fil-C with zero or minimal changes. All memory safety errors are caught as Fil-C panics. Fil-C achieves this using a combination of concurrent garbage collection and invisible capabilities (each pointer in memory has a corresponding capability, not visible to the C address space). Every fundamental C operation (as seen in LLVM IR) is checked against the capability. Fil-C has no unsafe statement and only limited FFI to unsafe code.
